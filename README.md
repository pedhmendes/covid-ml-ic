# COVID-19 and Machine Learning IC
This repo contains all thing about my 2020 IF research. I worked with Professor Marco A. P. Idiart, from the Complex Fluids Group IF-UFRGS. I studied Machine Learning applied for COVID-19, my goal was to identify the important biomarkers within blood tests. 

In the *01-chinese_dataset_xgb.ipynb* one can find the first version of my code. In this one there is two trainings. I did not know exactly what I was doing, I only edited the last student code in my way. You can find his version in this [link](https://github.com/rjribeiro/covid_ic).

In the *02-chinese_dataset_rf_xgb.ipynb* one can find the second version of my code, and the one I used to write the final report. In this version I train only once, but using Random Forest and XGBoost.

Python versions are also available.

*time_series_375_prerpocess_en.xlsx* is the dataset I used for both trainings. The dataset is from this article "*An interpretable mortality prediction model for COVID-19 patients*" link [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-0180-7).

All figures are in the *figures* folder.

There is one presentation I did a presentation for my friends in the [GFC](https://github.com/gfc-fiscomp) group. The PDF and latex's source are in this repo. My final report in PDF and latex's source is here as well.
